In the PyBank example, I wrote Python scripts to analyze a company's financial records provided in a CSV. 

My script determines:

	-The total number of months included in the dataset
	-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
	-The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
	-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
	-The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

In the PyPoll example, I wrote Python scripts to analyze mock election data provided in a CSV. 

My script determines:

	-The total number of votes cast
	-A complete list of candidates who received votes
	-The percentage of votes each candidate won
	-The total number of votes each candidate won
	-The winner of the election based on popular vote

In the PyBoss example, I wrote Python scripts to clean/format employee data provided a CSV. 

My script makes the following changes to the CSV:

	-The Name column is split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.
	-The DOB data is re-written into MM/DD/YYYY format.
	-The SSN data is re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
	-The State data is re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.

In the PyParagraph example, I wrote Python scripts to automate the analysis of any passage/text file. 

My script provides the following metrics:

	-Approximate word count
	-Approximate sentence count
	-Approximate letter count (per word)
	-Average sentence length (in words)
